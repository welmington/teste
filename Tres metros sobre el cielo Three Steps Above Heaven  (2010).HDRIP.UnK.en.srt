1
00:00:29,792 --> 00:00:31,042
<i>One day it happens.</i>

2
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,208
<i>You're standing somewhere</i>

3
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:37,875
<i>and you realize you don't want
to be any of those around you.</i>

4
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:49,667
<i>You don't want to be
the dickhead you just beat up.</i>

5
00:00:57,708 --> 00:01:01,708
Your honor, I've got
15 stitches here and 25 here.

6
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:03,583
<i>Or your father,</i>

7
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:05,708
<i>or your brother,</i>

8
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,625
<i>or anyone
in your fucking family.</i>

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,417
Son of a bitch!

10
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,917
The accused will stand.

11
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:33,750
This court finds
Hugo Olivera Castro

12
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,583
guilty of assault,

13
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:37,000
<i>Or the judge.</i>

14
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,792
And sentences him
to 18 months in prison,

15
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,792
commuted to a fine of 6,000 euros
as this is a first offense.

16
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,125
<i>Or even yourself.</i>

17
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,750
Court is adjourned.

18
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:51,083
<i>You just want to run away.</i>

19
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,542
You must be careful
from now on.

20
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:58,250
There can be
no more violent incidents.

21
00:01:58,458 --> 00:02:01,542
Another offense
means you'll go to prison.

22
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:04,083
Hugo, are you listening?

23
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:06,542
- Why didn't mom come?
- She's on a trip.

24
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,208
And don't call me Hugo.

25
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,125
Fuck.

26
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:22,542
<i>Get the hell out
of wherever you are.</i>

27
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:49,375
Come on!

28
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:02,458
<i>And suddenly it happens.</i>

29
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,250
<i>Something clicks.</i>

30
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,625
<i>And you know that
things are going to change.</i>

31
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,500
<i>They've changed already.</i>

32
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,500
Dogface!

33
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:27,375
Yeah, you!

34
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:37,708
Dogface.

35
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,042
<i>And they'll never
be the same again.</i>

36
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:04,000
- Bye, dad.
- Bye.

37
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,375
<i>Never.</i>

38
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,958
<i>And when it happens,</i>

39
00:05:10,917 --> 00:05:12,167
<i>you know.</i>

40
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:15,958
THREE METERS ABOVE THE SKY

41
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,625
- Babi!
- Okay.

42
00:05:21,958 --> 00:05:23,042
Hurry!

43
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,000
Good morning.
Silence.

44
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:28,833
Silence!

45
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,208
- May I?
- Late.

46
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,792
Close your notebooks, please.

47
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:42,458
She'll pick me.

48
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:43,750
Fernández Camino,

49
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,958
Luna Vergara,

50
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,833
and Dueñas Martín....

51
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,917
No, she's outside.

52
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,375
Absent.

53
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,292
So,

54
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,667
Herreruela.

55
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,375
Translation.

56
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,292
Take your phone.

57
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:05,375
Domus itinere

58
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,500
eunte,

59
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,583
moltus

60
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:15,875
ambulantus

61
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,625
fuit.

62
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:30,000
Herreruela...

63
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,917
On the way home

64
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,083
he had to walk a lot.

65
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:44,542
A lot.

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,417
You'll have to study a lot
to get into college.

67
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:52,958
Cell.

68
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:17,792
Miss Alcázar,

69
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,417
won't you take my call?

70
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,292
Sit down.

71
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,917
We'll continue. De strictus
sensi cui super impia.

72
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,917
Babi!

73
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:37,375
I'm sorry.

74
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,458
- It's OK.
- Silence!

75
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,625
Mara, doing it a few times
doesn't mean you're dating.

76
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,000
So what? Anyway, his pals
told me he never calls.

77
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:07,583
And you believe his pals?
Just look at them.

78
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:16,083
Claudio,

79
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:17,625
change your tie.

80
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,833
This looks better.

81
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:25,083
- Girls, are you ready?
- Yes, mom.

82
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:27,542
If you want a lift,
we're leaving now!

83
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,875
With this make-up,
how old do I look?

84
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,000
At least 15.

85
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,167
But I am 15.

86
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,417
Let's see.

87
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,167
Like that,

88
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,083
you're about to turn 16.

89
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,458
H!

90
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:11,083
I wouldn't ask, but it's urgent.
I need 400 euros for my bike.

91
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:14,625
- It's in the repair shop!
- Don't worry about that now.

92
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,500
Chino!

93
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:30,042
We've got a new contest
on the Bandstand!

94
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,167
Are you ready?

95
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,250
The countdown has started!

96
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:39,708
Who'll be king of the Bandstand?

97
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:41,875
On your marks! Get ready!

98
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,125
Go!

99
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,417
One!

100
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,375
Two!

101
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:48,167
Three! Four!

102
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,583
Five! Six!

103
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,292
Don't act like you're desperately
seeking someone.

104
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,167
But I am.

105
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:05,750
There he is!

106
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:07,042
Dani!

107
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:10,792
- Don't go....
- Hi, Rubén!

108
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,750
Shit, with all that make-up
I didn't recognize you.

109
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,042
Would you like something?

110
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,667
Yes, come on.

111
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:28,500
Thirty!

112
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:29,958
Thirty one!

113
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,250
Thirty two!

114
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,417
Thirty three!

115
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,458
- Thirty four!
- That's the first one down!

116
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:40,292
Katina!

117
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,417
I thought you weren't coming!

118
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:46,583
I was at another party,
but it was full of gays.

119
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:47,500
A real bore.

120
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:50,375
Someone else who was bored
brought me here.

121
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:53,250
That's him,
chasing Berta's brother.

122
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:57,875
Hello!

123
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,958
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, yes!

124
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:02,583
Thank you.
Want some?

125
00:11:03,292 --> 00:11:05,833
No? Well, the drinks
are back there

126
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,375
and there's a bar outside.

127
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,125
See you later!

128
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:14,208
I love this song.
Let's talk to my new gay friend.

129
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,250
Fifty one! Fifty two!

130
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,042
Fifty three!

131
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,667
Travolta, you're slipping!

132
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,542
Fifty six! Fifty seven!

133
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,750
Eighty two! Eighty three!

134
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,958
Eighty four! Eighty five!

135
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:05,625
Ten seconds! Come on!
Let's have a final sprint!

136
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:09,833
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

137
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:11,792
Come on!

138
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,875
Seven, eight,

139
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:18,000
nine,

140
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,375
- and ten!
- Ten!

141
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,042
There's a new king
of the Bandstand!

142
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,750
Chino has lost his throne
after two years!

143
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,917
There's a private party up town!

144
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,833
- Can we go?
- Sure, I've got tickets!

145
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,542
- Coming?
- Not to a rich kids' party.

146
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,167
Will you ever forgive me?

147
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:06,333
I've been looking for a reason
to do it, but I can't find one.

148
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:07,792
Typical of a woman.

149
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,708
See? That ''typical''
is what ruins everything.

150
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,625
You're beautiful tonight.

151
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,375
Tonight?

152
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,167
Always.

153
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,333
Alicia, your brother rang,
he's coming with some friends.

154
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,917
But I'm an only child!

155
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,583
- Yes?
- Hello!

156
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,958
- Who's my brother?
- Sis!

157
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:40,625
Sis!

158
00:13:41,792 --> 00:13:43,667
There are canapés....

159
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,375
Listen to the music!

160
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:58,708
My little sister!

161
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,000
Close the door!

162
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:49,333
What do you want?

163
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:50,833
My purse.

164
00:14:51,167 --> 00:14:53,000
- Take it.
- I can't.

165
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,125
Some idiot got it first.

166
00:14:58,167 --> 00:14:59,292
Here.

167
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,458
Didn't your mother tell you
not to snoop in girls' purses?

168
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,333
I don't know my mother.

169
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,125
- But I'd tell yours something.
- Really? What?

170
00:15:11,917 --> 00:15:14,583
You can't go around
with just 50 euros.

171
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:16,250
That's my week's allowance.

172
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,792
- It was.
- Now I'll go hungry.

173
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,542
If you want,
I'll buy you lunch tomorrow.

174
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:24,542
You know what?

175
00:15:24,792 --> 00:15:27,792
When I'm paying,
I like to choose my company.

176
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,208
- What's that?
- Never mind!

177
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,333
Stop it! Stop!

178
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,875
Holy shit!

179
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:39,542
Forget about lunch.
What would we do after?

180
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,875
Tell jokes?

181
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:46,042
Look, I wouldn't laugh at yours
and you wouldn't understand mine.

182
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,750
The jokes, I mean.

183
00:15:48,417 --> 00:15:49,583
Half-wit!

184
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,542
If you dare take any alcohol
I'll tell mom.

185
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,667
Excuse me?

186
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,167
Don't you remember?

187
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,458
I accompanied you to school
this morning.

188
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,917
Well, I was your escort.

189
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:14,000
You were the one
shouting stupidities.

190
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:18,292
No, I just said one.
''Dogface''.

191
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:19,875
You liked it, right?

192
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:22,167
It always works
with girls like you.

193
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:23,333
Like me?

194
00:16:23,542 --> 00:16:25,333
Up-tight and keen to break out.

195
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,625
Do you want something?

196
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,458
A Coca-cola, please.

197
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:31,750
I have to drive.

198
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,250
Babi?

199
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,000
No, I served myself.

200
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:40,333
See? When you're pleasant
you're not such a dogface.

201
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,583
What?

202
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,458
- Chico!
- Pollo, take this.

203
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:57,875
No, put me down, you brute!
Let go of me!

204
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,333
No, no! I'm sorry I threw
the milk shake at you!

205
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:14,333
The damage has been done.

206
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,583
You're out of your mind!

207
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,917
I'm wearing a Valentino!

208
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,083
- It's freezing!
- It's good for the circulation.

209
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,458
It pumps more blood
to your brain.

210
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:47,083
You offer milk shakes,
you don't throw them at people.

211
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,792
And tell Valentino

212
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,500
the dress looks a lot better wet.

213
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,000
The police, please.

214
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,708
Shall I get you a towel?

215
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:02,583
You don't want to catch cold.

216
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:04,208
Go to hell!

217
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,958
Move, they rang the cops!

218
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,292
Remind me

219
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,792
the next time we bathe together
to wash your mouth with soap.

220
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,792
Why did you do nothing
when he threw me in the pool?

221
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,833
Babi,

222
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,875
it was all a set-up.

223
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,083
I rang those idiots to cause
a fuss so I could be with you.

224
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,417
Roberta will never forgive you.

225
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,333
They wrecked the house.

226
00:18:42,542 --> 00:18:43,917
What the hell?

227
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,375
What are they doing?

228
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,958
Go away!

229
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,708
Stop it, please!

230
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,292
This is my father's car!

231
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,667
Bastards!

232
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,167
You want aggro?

233
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,458
- You're fucking crazy!
- Go to hell!

234
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,625
Are you OK?

235
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,708
Shit!

236
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:51,417
It's nothing.

237
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,167
Just some scratches.

238
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,208
- They could have killed us!
- It's all right.

239
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:56,917
There's still time.

240
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,208
- I'm sorry!
- Sorry?

241
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:01,000
For what? Tell me.

242
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,833
For calling the police
or for the hit and run?

243
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:04,958
You're so sexy.

244
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:07,292
Leave him alone, you animal!

245
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,042
You brute! Leave him alone!
You're despicable!

246
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,833
You want to grovel?

247
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:15,583
All right, say after me:

248
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,875
- I will not ruin the party...
- Stop!

249
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:22,833
I will not ruin the party

250
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:25,292
for people who know
how to have fun.

251
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,625
I won't ruin the party...

252
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,083
Please, help me!

253
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:31,542
....for people who know
how to have fun.

254
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,375
- Mr. Santamaría!
- What's going on?

255
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,875
They're going
to kill each other!

256
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:37,750
Boys, that's enough!

257
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,333
Let's get out of here!
Babi, come with us!

258
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,125
Fuck, it was your fault
that I hit him!

259
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,750
You made me hit him!

260
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,833
Get in the car!

261
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:52,042
- I won't....
- I won't ruin... That's it.

262
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:54,125
Leave him alone!

263
00:20:54,917 --> 00:20:56,125
I hate you!

264
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:59,333
You're an animal, a brute!

265
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:00,917
I hate you!

266
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,792
Put me down!

267
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,125
All right,
I've put you down.

268
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,917
And he's gone.

269
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,167
I'll say goodbye too.

270
00:21:19,292 --> 00:21:21,083
How do I get home?

271
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:36,875
- Let me get on the bike.
- What?

272
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,708
Let me get on the bike.

273
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:42,292
You said I'm an animal
and a brute, right?

274
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,417
I can't let someone like that
take you home.

275
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:48,208
It's for your own good.

276
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,083
Tomorrow you'd regret
not being consistent.

277
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:56,167
Stop, please.

278
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,625
Want to go somewhere?

279
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,750
You want your face smashed?

280
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:00,917
Scram.

281
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,167
Scram!

282
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:12,833
Get on, I've fought enough people
because of you.

283
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:30,958
Wait, wait.

284
00:22:31,167 --> 00:22:32,375
I'm paralyzed.

285
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,250
You're squeezing me.

286
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,292
If you grab my jacket
I can't drive.

287
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:40,375
Please...

288
00:23:05,292 --> 00:23:08,250
You want to stay like this
all night?

289
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,542
Sorry, I've never ridden
on the back of a bike.

290
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:14,375
So I'm the first, right?

291
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:17,667
Shit!

292
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,292
Babi!

293
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:29,333
- Did you come on that bike?
- No, mom...

294
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:32,667
She had no choice, ma'am, really.

295
00:23:34,292 --> 00:23:36,417
The boy who was driving her
dumped her

296
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:38,917
and she had to come with me.

297
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:42,542
Hi, mom!

298
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,708
Didn't I tell you
to stay with your sister!

299
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:47,625
- Hello.
- Hi.

300
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:49,708
Get in the car.

301
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:53,042
You two won't have
any kind of phone for a week!

302
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,833
You're exactly like your mother.

303
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:57,708
A grouch.

304
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:06,417
Are you seeing that guy?

305
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't even know him.

306
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,917
He's Hugo Olivera,

307
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,417
but they call him H.

308
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:14,875
Something horrible happened
and he wants to forget his name.

309
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:17,625
My friends and I say
it's H for ''hero''.

310
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,042
He looks like
he'd save your life.

311
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:26,958
Who the hell let you in?

312
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:30,125
- Get up, you've things to do!
- Yeah, for you!

313
00:24:32,875 --> 00:24:34,333
No, I understand.

314
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:38,917
But I could go to Paris next week
and we'll close the deal.

315
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:43,042
Alex, I need to borrow 400 euros.

316
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:44,875
Fuck, what a drag.

317
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:45,750
Wait.

318
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,917
We'll talk to Head Office.

319
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:49,333
Yeah, sure.

320
00:24:50,042 --> 00:24:50,958
OK.

321
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:53,625
What are you doing?
Give me that!

322
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:56,917
Are you crazy?

323
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:58,958
Don't give it to him!

324
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,417
Don't speak! Don't speak!

325
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,833
Yes, of course.

326
00:25:03,042 --> 00:25:05,125
In my wallet, in my jacket.

327
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:12,542
Yes!

328
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:14,583
- No, of course.
- Thank you!

329
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,708
Really, if he can't,
I'll see to it.

330
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:20,542
Hugo, remember about dinner
with dad.

331
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:27,875
Are you sure it's here?

332
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:31,292
Yeah, I saw it in her diary,
and we're having lunch.

333
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,958
- You're broke.
- She said she'd pay.

334
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:37,667
- Hello.
- Hi.

335
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,542
That's her!

336
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:42,333
- Which one?
- The blonde.

337
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:43,625
- Bye, Babi.
- Bye.

338
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,667
And that's the girl
from the foam bath.

339
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:48,625
I'm off.

340
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,042
God, Babi!

341
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,167
That's the guy
who stole my allowance.

342
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:55,083
- Which one?
- The ugly one beside the bike.

343
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,875
Oh, no!

344
00:25:58,083 --> 00:25:59,292
Did he steal from you too?

345
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,000
No, but his pal threw me in the pool
and wrecked Chico's car.

346
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:06,000
You never tell me
the interesting things!

347
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:08,458
Hello.

348
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,292
What are you doing here?

349
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,750
Hey, take it easy.

350
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,125
I just came with my friend,
he's having lunch with that girl.

351
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,583
But she happens
to be my best friend

352
00:26:18,792 --> 00:26:20,833
and your friend
stole all her money.

353
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,250
You owe me one.

354
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,542
Why not invite me somewhere nice?

355
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,167
What do you say?

356
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,333
Moron!

357
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:31,167
How sweet!

358
00:26:31,375 --> 00:26:32,708
Coming for lunch?

359
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:34,625
You can't have lunch with him!

360
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:37,458
But he's paying, so I'll get
some of my money back.

361
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:39,375
I thought she was paying.

362
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,167
I swiped her money yesterday

363
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:43,625
so it's like she was paying.

364
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,208
Don't be angry.

365
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:47,458
I'll call you later.

366
00:26:49,542 --> 00:26:50,625
Excuse me.

367
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,875
Just to show I'm not a liar,

368
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,417
didn't you and I have
a foam bath yesterday?

369
00:27:02,583 --> 00:27:04,208
That's a yes.

370
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,083
- Hi, mom.
- Hello, love.

371
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:18,292
Why is your brother so late?

372
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:21,792
You know him,
he's always working.

373
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,833
Where's mom?

374
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:29,583
On a trip,
with a girl friend.

375
00:28:04,167 --> 00:28:06,250
What grade will you get?
8 or more?

376
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,250
In Physics?
A distinction, definitely.

377
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:18,083
I'm popping out.
Do you need anything?

378
00:28:18,292 --> 00:28:20,542
No, I'll take a break later.

379
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,208
Wrap up well if you go out.
It's freezing.

380
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,833
Yes, mom.

381
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:44,042
Rebeca, did your son
ever argue with that man before?

382
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,792
I didn't even know
they knew each other.

383
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,500
With his injuries,

384
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:51,708
if we don't have some proof

385
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,000
Hugo could be in big trouble.

386
00:28:54,208 --> 00:28:56,333
Do you think
I don't want to help my son?

387
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:00,875
Hugo,

388
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:03,500
have you nothing to say?

389
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:05,667
I'm moving in with you.

390
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,042
Don't you want to know
how it went?

391
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,542
How did it go?

392
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,458
If you ask like that
I won't tell you.

393
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:24,583
- All right, don't.
- Babi!

394
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:31,875
Excuse me, that blonde hunk
was giving you the eye.

395
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:36,958
He's still doing it.
Shall we follow him?

396
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:40,667
Why are you looking like that?

397
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:43,708
You dumped me
and went off with that thug.

398
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,792
Hey, you don't know him!

399
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,667
He's got problems.

400
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,042
He's got no money.
His father treats him badly.

401
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:52,708
But he's really nice.

402
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:55,000
He asked me
to the races tonight.

403
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:55,833
What races?

404
00:29:56,042 --> 00:29:57,875
I told mom
I'm sleeping at your house.

405
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,792
- Leave a key under the mat.
- I don't believe this!

406
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,417
- Why don't you come?
- No!

407
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,875
I don't want to see him
or his friend.

408
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:08,083
Then we're not going
to see each other either.

409
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:10,958
- Why not?
- I'm going out with him!

410
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:14,083
Katina!

411
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,500
- Babi!
- Yes?

412
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,375
Come here a moment.

413
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:21,750
Coming.

414
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:27,708
What?

415
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:32,750
Haven't you something to tell us?

416
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,542
The Santamarías rang.

417
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,792
Felipe's nasal septum was broken,
it almost pierced his brain!

418
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,458
- I had nothing to do with it.
- It's true, she didn't.

419
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:45,750
Who asked you?
Be quiet!

420
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:47,417
Look, Babi,

421
00:30:47,625 --> 00:30:51,125
they want to report your friend.
They want to know his name.

422
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,958
He's not my friend.
I just know he's called H.

423
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:57,583
Are you defending him?
How long have you known him?

424
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,958
The only thing I know
is his nickname!

425
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:03,708
You know his name, tell them!

426
00:31:04,042 --> 00:31:08,000
- Do you think I'm a telltale?
- You told me his name.

427
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:09,958
Daniela, his name.

428
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,583
Hugo Olivera.
That's his name, dad.

429
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,292
Call them, and say
Babi had nothing to do with it.

430
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:23,167
Great, Babi, you've really
put your foot in it!

431
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,292
Daniela...

432
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,583
My parents are out.

433
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,625
Yes, she's here.

434
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:36,042
But I reckon that in a week
she'll be dead.

435
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,333
She informed on a dangerous guy,
and she likes him.

436
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,917
Stop talking about me
and hang up.

437
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:44,125
Wait, I've got another call.

438
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,375
Yes?

439
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:49,708
Yes, just a minute.

440
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:51,500
It's for you.

441
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,542
Yes?

442
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,667
Good evening!
Yes.

443
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:02,875
Katina? She's sleeping.

444
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,042
Shall I wake her?

445
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:09,708
Yes, I'll tell her.

446
00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:10,667
Good night.

447
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:12,375
Bye.

448
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:14,625
What's going on?

449
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,042
What is it?
Who was that?

450
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,542
It's turned off.

451
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:21,750
Where are the bike races?

452
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:24,125
The Siamese races?
At the port.

453
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,292
- Can I go? Please....
- No way.

454
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,917
And don't tell anyone.

455
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:33,958
Know where my sister's going?

456
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,708
WE REMEMBERYOU

457
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:14,000
No, stop, Pollo!

458
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,417
What a surprise!
I'm so glad you've come!

459
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:25,875
Why is your phone off?
Your mother rang.

460
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:29,000
- What did you tell her?
- That you were asleep,

461
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,583
and she believed me.

462
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:34,125
She's picking you up tomorrow
at 7:00 for your blood tests.

463
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:37,125
Don't be late,
I don't want any problems.

464
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:38,500
- Come on, stay!
- No!

465
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,167
We're going for a pizza.

466
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,375
I doubt I'd eat
the pizzas you eat.

467
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:46,250
Well, it's the untamed shrew!

468
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,417
Have you come to see me race?

469
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:51,125
I didn't even know
you were here.

470
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,458
Then why are you
red as a beetroot?

471
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,000
You just make me laugh.

472
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:56,375
- Yeah?
- Yes.

473
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,125
You won't be so cocky in court.

474
00:33:59,708 --> 00:34:02,833
I said it was you who broke
Mr. Santamaría's nose.

475
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,042
- You bitch!
- Take it easy.

476
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,625
You could go to prison!

477
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:12,208
That won't happen, OK?

478
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:18,042
The day I'm up in court

479
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:21,042
this nice girl will say
I did nothing. Know why?

480
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:22,917
Why?

481
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:27,500
By then you'll be so crazy about me
you'll do anything to save me.

482
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,208
The race is starting!

483
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:34,500
The race is starting!

484
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:38,000
Want to ride behind me?

485
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,875
Never.

486
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:44,292
H, will you take me?

487
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,125
Get on.

488
00:34:48,792 --> 00:34:50,625
Stop being scared
and you'll have fun.

489
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,042
You don't even have a belt.

490
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,500
This is just for Siamese.
So, race or fuck off.

491
00:34:56,708 --> 00:34:58,042
She's a real cow.

492
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,958
- What did you say?
- I'm racing now.

493
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,583
Well, then?

494
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:05,958
Give me your belt.

495
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:07,917
Babi, no!

496
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:13,917
Shit, my scarf!

497
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:19,917
Get on!

498
00:35:22,792 --> 00:35:24,458
Are you crazy?
Don't!

499
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:27,042
I haven't got all day.

500
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:37,375
Good luck!

501
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,000
Belts off!

502
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:21,875
Come on!

503
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:40,000
Up! Up!

504
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:01,750
Last lap!

505
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,625
Chino!

506
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,125
Stop! Stop!

507
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:42,083
Stop! Stop!

508
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:47,542
Shit!

509
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:05,000
Forget the bike, help her!

510
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:08,833
Don't move her!

511
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:11,000
- Lift her up!
- Call an ambulance!

512
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,625
Get on! Get on!

513
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:31,542
The cameras!
Cover the license plate!

514
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:41,625
Hide here!

515
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,708
I'll pick you up
once I shake them off.

516
00:39:44,917 --> 00:39:46,333
Quick!

517
00:39:53,833 --> 00:39:55,250
Shit!

518
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:15,625
I'm here.

519
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,375
- Where?
- Here.

520
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,833
Why are you in there?
Come out.

521
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,000
There's a huge dog out there.

522
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,667
There's no dog here.

523
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,792
I still can't come out.

524
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,208
Why?

525
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,917
I'm embarrassed.

526
00:40:32,958 --> 00:40:34,875
Come out now or I'll leave.

527
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,250
No, wait!

528
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:37,625
Wait!

529
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:38,750
What?

530
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:41,208
Promise you won't laugh.

531
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:43,750
I promise.

532
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:56,375
What have you done, kid?

533
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,208
- Are you covered in mud?
- It's manure.

534
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,292
That's manure?

535
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,958
I don't believe it!
This is too good to be true.

536
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:08,917
I knew it.
Your promises are worthless.

537
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:12,833
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I'm getting on the bike!

538
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:14,583
Are you crazy?

539
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:16,583
You're covered in shit.

540
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,167
- You're joking, right?
- No.

541
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:26,750
If you want,
you can wear my jacket.

542
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:29,625
But first take off those clothes

543
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:32,375
or you can't get on the bike.

544
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:37,375
Fuck, this is disgusting!

545
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:40,375
- Look, H...
- I like how that sounds.

546
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,458
It's the first time
you've said my name.

547
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:44,958
If you turn round

548
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:47,917
I swear I'll jump on you
and cover you with manure.

549
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:50,042
And I do keep my promises.

550
00:41:51,292 --> 00:41:52,375
Don't look!

551
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,708
I've got no interest in looking.

552
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:01,042
I'd appreciate it if you'd hurry.

553
00:42:05,667 --> 00:42:08,458
You're a filthy,
disgusting bastard!

554
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:11,917
I didn't turn round, did I?
But you've got a great ass.

555
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:14,542
I wish I'd rubbed the manure
in your face.

556
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,708
Now I do hear a rabid dog.

557
00:42:16,917 --> 00:42:18,542
- Hurry up!
- Look!

558
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,000
Lift your legs
or he'II bite you!

559
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,708
Thank you for the lift.

560
00:43:07,542 --> 00:43:09,583
So I'll pick you up tomorrow.

561
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:11,125
What time?

562
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:13,708
Sure, and the police
can chase us again.

563
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:15,083
Right.

564
00:43:50,042 --> 00:43:52,333
You were a very brave Siamese.

565
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:55,375
Are you going to report me?

566
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,625
- Yes.
- Yes?

567
00:43:57,792 --> 00:44:00,333
Really?
Do you swear?

568
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,542
Oh, Babi, Babi!

569
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:24,375
I'm a pig, an animal, a beast,

570
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,167
but you'd let me kiss you.

571
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:28,333
- You're inconsistent.
- And you're a bastard!

572
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:31,958
You had your mouth open,
begging me to kiss you.

573
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:36,000
Give me back my jacket right now.

574
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,292
Hotlips,

575
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,458
what about a good night kiss?

576
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:43,083
Go to hell!

577
00:44:59,333 --> 00:45:01,042
I was really worried.

578
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,958
Your mom thought I was you
and gave me a good night kiss.

579
00:45:04,167 --> 00:45:06,250
- What happened?
- It was H, wasn't it?

580
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,458
He tore off your clothes.

581
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:10,042
You'll wake mom.

582
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,250
Well?

583
00:45:13,375 --> 00:45:14,583
I'm going to shower.

584
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,083
She smells of shit.

585
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:28,875
Sorry, the police were after me.

586
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:32,833
Liar, I saw you go off
with that stuck-up little mouse.

587
00:45:53,958 --> 00:45:56,917
Illegal races cause disturbances
in the port area

588
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:07,500
Throw it up to me!

589
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:08,833
Come on!

590
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:24,833
She raced as a Siamese

591
00:46:25,042 --> 00:46:26,958
and saved a girl
who had an accident.

592
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:28,375
It's really wild.

593
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:30,375
- Are you going out?
- No!

594
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:32,708
Sure.

595
00:46:37,792 --> 00:46:40,375
Katina, not again.
I'm not going out.

596
00:46:43,958 --> 00:46:45,500
Look who's waiting for you

597
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:12,708
Babi! You're seeing H,
aren't you?

598
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:16,167
If mom and dad ask,
I'm studying at Katina's.

599
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,500
OK.

600
00:47:17,708 --> 00:47:19,417
I'll be back by 11:00.

601
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:22,875
I'm the hero's sister-in-law.

602
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,167
H...

603
00:47:42,792 --> 00:47:44,042
Got a light?

604
00:47:49,458 --> 00:47:50,542
What's up?

605
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,167
New projects.

606
00:47:52,667 --> 00:47:57,125
Good luck, I don't think that prude
will open her legs so easily.

607
00:48:00,917 --> 00:48:02,292
I'll call you, OK?

608
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:26,500
Vodka with pineapple.

609
00:50:21,917 --> 00:50:23,208
Dogface.

610
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:25,875
Brute.

611
00:51:13,708 --> 00:51:15,083
Mom, why are you still up?

612
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:22,708
Why are you behaving
as if you weren't my daughter?

613
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,167
It got late.

614
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:25,667
Come here!

615
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:42,833
- Were you drinking?
- You know I don't drink.

616
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:47,042
What's that boy doing to you?

617
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:51,417
- Is he making you do anything?
- Nothing I don't want to do.

618
00:51:54,708 --> 00:51:55,833
Is anything wrong?

619
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,458
No, dad, I came home late,
that's all.

620
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,583
I got his license plate.

621
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:12,750
- Talk to him.
- They're just kids.

622
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:15,500
Tell him if he doesn't leave
our daughter alone,

623
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:17,458
he'll be in trouble!

624
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:32,417
Is that you?

625
00:52:35,542 --> 00:52:36,667
I want to see you.

626
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:44,625
I'm grounded.
I got caught coming home late.

627
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,750
So it's not an urban legend.

628
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,750
Nice girls who behave badly

629
00:52:51,958 --> 00:52:53,417
are still grounded.

630
00:52:55,792 --> 00:52:57,125
What'll we do tomorrow?

631
00:52:58,375 --> 00:52:59,583
Go off somewhere.

632
00:53:03,042 --> 00:53:05,667
Pick me up at the school gate
and take me away.

633
00:53:06,083 --> 00:53:07,958
I haven't been up that early

634
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:09,375
for over a year.

635
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:10,750
I might sleep in.

636
00:53:13,833 --> 00:53:15,292
I trust you, H.

637
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:18,000
Good night.

638
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:20,833
Bye, Babi.

639
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:26,042
- Bye, Babi.
- Bye.

640
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,125
Let's go inside.

641
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:44,208
I can't. H is coming.

642
00:53:44,417 --> 00:53:46,083
- We're going off!
- What?

643
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:47,833
You're going to screw!

644
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:51,375
As your best friend,
I want all the details.

645
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:52,542
You animal!

646
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:54,542
No, I'm really excited.

647
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:57,167
It's like I was
losing my virginity again.

648
00:53:59,917 --> 00:54:02,375
- There he is! Wish me luck.
- Lots of luck.

649
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:10,375
Babi! Relax your pelvis.

650
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,458
Hello.

651
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:43,875
Look who's there.

652
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:49,500
Hugo...

653
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:51,875
Hugo, please.

654
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:53,625
Hugo, stop, please!

655
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,250
H, what is it?

656
00:54:57,458 --> 00:55:00,167
Hugo, please, don't!

657
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:14,792
In physics?
A distinction, definitely.

658
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,667
I'm popping out.
Do you need anything?

659
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:21,042
No, I'll take a break later.

660
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:45,375
Son of a bitch!

661
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:56,917
Stop!

662
00:55:59,042 --> 00:55:59,708
Please, Hugo!

663
00:56:00,917 --> 00:56:01,750
Please, stop!

664
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,083
H, please!

665
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,458
Stop, Hugo!

666
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:08,667
Stop!

667
00:56:12,542 --> 00:56:13,583
Are you crazy?

668
00:56:13,792 --> 00:56:15,417
You could have killed us!

669
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:16,833
Stop!

670
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:25,292
Stop!

671
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:26,917
Stop!

672
00:56:28,458 --> 00:56:29,417
Stop, please!

673
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:31,375
H! Stop, stop!

674
00:56:53,625 --> 00:56:55,000
Who was that woman?

675
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,667
She was my mother.

676
00:57:18,542 --> 00:57:21,583
Your father and your brother
don't know?

677
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:25,083
My father thinks
she's with her friends.

678
00:57:30,833 --> 00:57:32,667
Am I the only one who knows?

679
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,208
Stop, stop!

680
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:38,042
Why?

681
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:41,208
We're out in the open.

682
00:58:43,792 --> 00:58:45,583
There's no one here.

683
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:01,208
I said no.

684
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,458
OK.

685
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:11,667
Come here.

686
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:12,875
Come on.

687
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:44,792
Why did you bring me here?

688
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,125
Don't you like it?

689
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:50,625
My parents always brought us here
when we were little.

690
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:53,625
See the house that's for sale?

691
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:54,458
Yes.

692
01:00:55,833 --> 01:00:57,958
My sister and I
pretended it was ours.

693
01:00:58,167 --> 01:01:02,083
We used to see the owners
and we imagined we were them.

694
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,167
It's so sad.

695
01:01:14,542 --> 01:01:16,958
It's like we can
never enjoy it again.

696
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:21,208
I knew you'd like it.

697
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:33,792
The jacket suits you.

698
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:39,250
Who's calling?

699
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:44,042
My mother doesn't trust me.

700
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,417
Or rather, you.

701
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,958
Is that like mom's signature?

702
01:02:29,042 --> 01:02:30,708
I think it's perfect.

703
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:32,875
- Thank you for helping me.
- Not at all.

704
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:35,375
Don't go yet,
come and meet my daughters.

705
01:02:35,958 --> 01:02:37,000
Girls,

706
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:42,083
this is Gustavo,
our new upstairs neighbor.

707
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:44,875
- Yes, we've seen each other.
- Yes.

708
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:49,125
He doesn't know anyone,
I said you could take him out

709
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,750
and introduce him.

710
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:52,500
Yes, mom, but not tonight.

711
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:55,458
The girls have asked me
to go to the cinema

712
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,250
and as I'm not grounded anymore
I can go, can't I?

713
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:02,667
I have to go.
My pleasure.

714
01:03:02,875 --> 01:03:04,083
Likewise.

715
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,292
Ciao.

716
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,875
This weekend, if I can,
I'll call him.

717
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:19,208
That hunk is walking
into the lion's den.

718
01:04:15,917 --> 01:04:17,167
You, ''Hello, Kitty".

719
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:19,292
This is yours, right?

720
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,292
You wouldn't have
such good taste.

721
01:04:21,542 --> 01:04:24,125
The other night, H used it
to tie me to the bed.

722
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:26,625
It's strong.

723
01:04:26,833 --> 01:04:28,333
Not strong enough
if you're here.

724
01:04:28,542 --> 01:04:29,583
Poor thing.

725
01:04:29,792 --> 01:04:32,500
You thought he'd promise you
eternal love, eh?

726
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,000
I feel sorry for you.

727
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:38,500
It's obvious
you're crazy about him.

728
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:43,125
Give me the scarf!
Give it to me!

729
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:44,542
- Let go!
- Give it to me!

730
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,125
- Get off!
- Let go of me!

731
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:47,667
- Stop it!
- Give me the scarf!

732
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:49,417
Let go, you bitch!

733
01:04:53,208 --> 01:04:54,208
Hit her, Babi!

734
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:02,917
Hit her, Babi, go on!

735
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:06,625
Hit her harder!

736
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:15,167
H!

737
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:17,250
Shit, it's Babi!

738
01:05:25,417 --> 01:05:27,250
Let go of me!

739
01:05:30,708 --> 01:05:33,167
The next time, I'll kill you,
you whore!

740
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:49,292
I don't know what happened me.

741
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:51,708
I didn't want to hurt her.

742
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:56,458
- She said you'd been with her....
- Babi, Babi....

743
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:01,875
I won't cheat on you
or hurt you.

744
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,292
I'm with you now.

745
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:10,250
With the girl who'll beat up
anyone who insults her guy.

746
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:18,750
You know what warriors do
after their first victory in battle?

747
01:07:16,917 --> 01:07:17,917
Hugo...

748
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,583
Someone wants a word with you.

749
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:26,750
I'm Claudio Alcázar,
Babi's father.

750
01:07:28,833 --> 01:07:31,917
- Shall we go down for a drink?
- Yes, of course.

751
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:33,917
Hugo,

752
01:07:34,625 --> 01:07:36,333
we have to talk.

753
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:43,583
- H, won't you introduce me?
- Of course.

754
01:07:44,792 --> 01:07:45,750
Rosanna, Claudio.

755
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:46,750
Claudio, Rosanna.

756
01:07:46,958 --> 01:07:48,625
- My pleasure.
- Likewise.

757
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:53,250
Sweetheart,
you want olives or nuts?

758
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:55,750
Olives.

759
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:00,125
She liked you.

760
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:01,958
She doesn't offer nuts
to everyone.

761
01:08:02,167 --> 01:08:03,958
- No?
- No.

762
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:08,417
I don't really know
where to begin.

763
01:08:08,917 --> 01:08:09,792
You see,

764
01:08:10,375 --> 01:08:11,417
my wife....

765
01:08:11,625 --> 01:08:15,417
Olives for the best looking man
to come in here this year.

766
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:17,708
Married, of course.

767
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:23,375
Claudio,

768
01:08:25,292 --> 01:08:28,458
I understand
that your wife is concerned.

769
01:08:29,792 --> 01:08:32,250
Her daughter is with a guy
who rides a motorbike,

770
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:34,458
racing around at 100 m.p.h.

771
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:37,417
Because I don't want
to see things.

772
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:40,833
But suddenly

773
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:43,792
someone appears and says
"Calm down",

774
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:45,750
"ease up''.

775
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:50,208
And when you ease up
you become aware of things.

776
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:55,625
That there's a dance trophy
among the bottles of tequila.

777
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:58,625
That my favorite song is playing.

778
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:00,667
That today is Tuesday 13th.

779
01:09:00,958 --> 01:09:04,708
And that Rosanna would run away
with you right now

780
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:06,417
to the ends of the earth.

781
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:08,708
Little things, Claudio.

782
01:09:10,208 --> 01:09:11,750
Your daughter is easing me up.

783
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,167
And that's good for me.

784
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:26,417
Not now, Alex.

785
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:29,875
What wrong with you? Didn't you
understand about prison?

786
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:33,417
You can't just do as you wish.
I'm sick of being your nursemaid!

787
01:09:33,667 --> 01:09:36,333
Stop messing around
and behave like an adult!

788
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:40,542
And what's that?

789
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:44,708
Being old at 30 and not knowing
how to enjoy life? Tell me!

790
01:09:51,917 --> 01:09:52,958
I'm sorry.

791
01:10:03,917 --> 01:10:05,833
- María Avellán.
- Present.

792
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:08,458
- Babi Alcázar.
- Present.

793
01:10:09,167 --> 01:10:10,583
Irene Catur...

794
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,458
Here you are.

795
01:10:15,083 --> 01:10:16,458
Miss Alcázar!

796
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:19,250
Did your mother sign this?

797
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:20,750
Yes.

798
01:10:21,292 --> 01:10:22,708
It's odd.

799
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:26,667
I've just spoken to her
and she didn't know you were ill.

800
01:10:28,417 --> 01:10:31,042
Nor that you were absent
on Friday.

801
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,750
She's on her way.

802
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:36,958
You know that what you've done

803
01:10:37,167 --> 01:10:40,000
means immediate expulsion
from this school?

804
01:10:43,708 --> 01:10:46,250
- Did they expel me, mom?
- No,

805
01:10:46,458 --> 01:10:49,792
because we've donated 8,000 euros
to the school.

806
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,542
- Mom, I promise...
- Be quiet, please!

807
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,833
Stop making a fool of me.

808
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,042
When did you decide
to laugh at me?

809
01:10:57,292 --> 01:10:59,458
I don't know you, Babi.

810
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:02,167
- Babi, what's wrong?
- Stay away, Katina.

811
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:03,792
And don't call!

812
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:05,458
She's in on it too, isn't she?

813
01:11:05,667 --> 01:11:08,333
It's time you stopped seeing her.

814
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:23,042
Katina said the teacher
is screwing you around.

815
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:25,208
They tried to expel me.

816
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:28,458
My parents paid a lot of money
to avoid it.

817
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:31,875
They're going to lower my grades.

818
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:34,458
I mightn't get into college.

819
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:42,875
Are you crazy?
You'll wake my parents!

820
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:44,250
Come on.

821
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:46,958
I'm not climbing down there.

822
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,708
- I'm scared.
- Scared?

823
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:50,833
You're brave.
Come on.

824
01:11:51,292 --> 01:11:52,750
- No!
- Come on.

825
01:11:58,417 --> 01:11:59,958
- Where are we going?
- Come on.

826
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:02,042
Trust me, Babi.

827
01:12:05,125 --> 01:12:07,250
- Hey, Pollo!
- Look who's here!

828
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:09,333
- Great!
- I didn't expect you.

829
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:12,375
- I told you.
- I bet 20 euros I didn't have.

830
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,000
Get in the water!

831
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:15,833
- I haven't got a costume.
- Come on.

832
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:17,167
No, H...

833
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:19,417
I've thrown you in before.

834
01:12:19,625 --> 01:12:20,750
Stop...

835
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:21,958
No!

836
01:12:22,167 --> 01:12:23,500
Come on, it's great!

837
01:12:25,583 --> 01:12:27,083
Save me, Babi!

838
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:29,375
- Come on, you two!
- Yeah, yeah.

839
01:12:32,042 --> 01:12:34,417
Stop! Stop, please!

840
01:13:18,333 --> 01:13:19,917
I have to tell you something.

841
01:13:22,042 --> 01:13:23,375
I'm nervous.

842
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:26,875
Why?

843
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:30,208
I've never done it.

844
01:13:34,917 --> 01:13:35,958
Me neither.

845
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:38,542
Liar!

846
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,667
Liar!

847
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,417
Babi! This lunatic just
asked me to marry him!

848
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:17,083
I'm not in a hurry, Babi.

849
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:46,042
You can't smoke here.

850
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:48,292
I'll be brief.

851
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:51,042
From now on,

852
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:53,458
you'll treat
one pupil very well.

853
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:56,083
If I hear that Babi

854
01:14:56,417 --> 01:14:58,667
has any problem
because of you

855
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:01,167
you're in trouble.

856
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:04,292
Don't waste your time
threatening me.

857
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,542
You're not the first.

858
01:15:10,042 --> 01:15:11,792
I'll just say one thing.

859
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,292
Listen carefully.

860
01:15:17,958 --> 01:15:19,000
Pepito.

861
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:20,417
Pepito!

862
01:15:21,458 --> 01:15:22,750
Fetch the ball!

863
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:24,167
Pepito!

864
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:25,708
The fucking ball!

865
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:28,500
This dog must have a trauma.

866
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:31,500
Like my aunt's dog,
it thinks it's a rabbit.

867
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,625
What's that thing?

868
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:42,042
No insults!

869
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:44,958
He's Pepito,
and he's a slow learner.

870
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,083
We bought him between us.

871
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:48,708
- Who has custody?
- Pollo.

872
01:15:48,917 --> 01:15:50,833
- But he's staying with his mom.
- What?

873
01:15:54,042 --> 01:15:56,167
- Don't leave him here!
- Better take him out

874
01:15:56,375 --> 01:15:58,292
or he'll piss on the carpet.

875
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,750
Bye, Alex.

876
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:01,833
What's wrong?

877
01:16:10,625 --> 01:16:14,208
If mom hears you're smoking in here,
she'll slice you up.

878
01:16:15,625 --> 01:16:18,000
But I won't say a word.

879
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:22,708
Shall we go see a movie?

880
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:26,333
I thought everyone knew
I'm grounded for life.

881
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:31,750
We'd planned to sleep over
at Katina's and now I can't go.

882
01:16:34,667 --> 01:16:36,208
Go on, and have fun.

883
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:40,083
And mom?

884
01:16:40,417 --> 01:16:41,875
I'll take care of that.

885
01:16:47,917 --> 01:16:52,250
I love the smell of a pipe.
It reminds me of when I was little.

886
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:05,000
- Hi!
- Hi!

887
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:51,292
FOR SALE

888
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,792
Wait here,
and don't look.

889
01:18:07,417 --> 01:18:08,708
I hear the sea!

890
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:13,500
What was that?

891
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:22,083
Come here.

892
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:26,000
There's a step, careful.

893
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,042
More steps.

894
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:37,292
Where are we going?

895
01:18:41,167 --> 01:18:43,000
I can smell it now.

896
01:18:46,875 --> 01:18:48,333
The sea!

897
01:19:06,333 --> 01:19:07,667
Like it?

898
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:13,458
Well?

899
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:20,917
I never want this to end.

900
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:44,958
This is incredible.

901
01:19:45,542 --> 01:19:46,958
It was your house, right?

902
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:49,625
I've bought it back for you.

903
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:51,000
You're crazy!

904
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:53,417
Now we're the owners.

905
01:20:12,167 --> 01:20:13,250
Are you all right?

906
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:15,208
What do you think?

907
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:18,708
Do you want me to be the first?

908
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,083
And the last.

909
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:23,500
Don't laugh.

910
01:21:23,917 --> 01:21:25,708
Relax, my love.

911
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:27,708
Relax.

912
01:21:49,917 --> 01:21:51,250
I love you, Babi.

913
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:34,875
Are you all right?

914
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,458
- Did I hurt you?
- No.

915
01:22:40,375 --> 01:22:42,000
I'm not very good, am I?

916
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,958
You're perfect.

917
01:22:46,792 --> 01:22:49,042
You made me feel great.

918
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:50,833
I'm happy.

919
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:52,208
I'm happier.

920
01:22:52,542 --> 01:22:54,042
No, I'm much happier.

921
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:57,958
- From here to Barcelona.
- From here to the sky.

922
01:22:58,167 --> 01:22:59,500
Well, I'm even happier.

923
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:01,000
How much?

924
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,500
Three meters above the sky.

925
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:51,167
Good morning!

926
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:10,000
Why is she babysitting?

927
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:11,958
Rich kids don't work.

928
01:24:12,167 --> 01:24:14,875
Her mother has stopped
her allowance.

929
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:17,125
Why did you bring Pepito?

930
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:20,875
He doesn't like being alone.
It upsets him.

931
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:22,792
No, it upsets you.

932
01:24:26,167 --> 01:24:28,125
We mustn't be apart!

933
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:32,042
Hi!

934
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:34,875
You brought Pollo and the dog?

935
01:24:35,208 --> 01:24:37,583
He can look after the kid.

936
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,667
Hey, champ.

937
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:42,583
You're playing tennis!

938
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:44,125
Get Pepito off the couch!

939
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:46,917
- He's called Pepito?
- Yes, he is.

940
01:24:47,125 --> 01:24:49,083
And I'm Pollo.
What's your name?

941
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:51,625
Show me your favorite part
of the house.

942
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:55,583
Come on,
or are you scared of me?

943
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:58,583
Come on, hit it hard.

944
01:25:02,208 --> 01:25:04,667
- Let's go to your parents' room.
- No, come in.

945
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:08,917
Sit down.

946
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,042
- May I?
- Yes.

947
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:52,167
- What was that?
- Don't worry, Pollo's in charge.

948
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:54,042
That's what worries me.

949
01:26:03,167 --> 01:26:06,333
Who the hell do you think you are?
A friend of mine?

950
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:09,583
- I'm sorry, Babi.
- Get this rabble out of here.

951
01:26:09,792 --> 01:26:11,500
- Get out!
- Everyone, out of here.

952
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:14,667
Get the fuck out!
What were you doing, Pollo?

953
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:17,083
I'm sorry.

954
01:26:17,292 --> 01:26:19,042
Parties here don't last long.

955
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:21,000
What are they doing here?

956
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:23,875
You get out too.
I don't want to see you.

957
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:26,000
Get out!

958
01:26:26,208 --> 01:26:27,750
You lot don't respect anything!

959
01:26:28,125 --> 01:26:30,000
Babi, this isn't my fault!

960
01:26:30,208 --> 01:26:31,333
Get out!

961
01:26:51,583 --> 01:26:55,125
Hi, this is Babi.
Leave a message.

962
01:27:14,292 --> 01:27:16,917
YOU AND I
3 M A S

963
01:27:41,167 --> 01:27:44,458
OK, the meat should be rare
with a little salt.

964
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:46,500
- A little salt.
- And the strawberries?

965
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:48,583
They're in the fridge.

966
01:27:48,792 --> 01:27:50,208
No, that's wrong!

967
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:54,958
Add the cream
just before you serve them.

968
01:27:55,167 --> 01:27:58,125
And light the candles
five minutes before she arrives.

969
01:27:58,333 --> 01:27:59,875
- Five minutes.
- Right.

970
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:03,292
- Why not apologize over the phone?
- The dog!

971
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,000
You're so unromantic!

972
01:28:05,292 --> 01:28:07,625
She's due at 8:00,
but she's always 10 minutes early.

973
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:08,833
OK.

974
01:28:09,292 --> 01:28:10,333
OK.

975
01:28:37,417 --> 01:28:38,625
- Yes?
- Hello.

976
01:28:40,667 --> 01:28:42,833
Babi, supper's getting cold.

977
01:28:43,042 --> 01:28:45,792
Mom's looking all over
for a ring her mother gave her.

978
01:28:46,125 --> 01:28:48,250
It's been missing
since your friends were here.

979
01:28:48,667 --> 01:28:51,583
Is it always going
to be like this with you?

980
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:55,875
- No, Babi.
- Leave me alone.

981
01:29:25,042 --> 01:29:26,000
Chino....

982
01:29:27,458 --> 01:29:28,417
Watch it!

983
01:29:29,792 --> 01:29:31,667
I don't want any problems.

984
01:29:34,917 --> 01:29:36,708
You don't want any problems?

985
01:29:37,875 --> 01:29:38,792
Tough guy.

986
01:29:41,917 --> 01:29:43,125
Don't touch me!

987
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:45,083
Look at him.

988
01:29:45,292 --> 01:29:46,750
He wants a fight.

989
01:29:54,583 --> 01:29:56,125
I just want the ring.

990
01:30:15,125 --> 01:30:18,083
H, stop, please!
Stop, you'll fucking kill him!

991
01:30:18,292 --> 01:30:20,958
I've got the ring!
I've got it!

992
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:40,750
- H, go away, please!
- Tell Babi to let me in!

993
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:43,208
She isn't here!

994
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:45,208
It's H! What'll I do?

995
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:47,792
My parents will be here soon!
Go away!

996
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,167
Let me in, Babi!

997
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:53,250
- I'll call the police.
- I have to give you something.

998
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:26,833
Why are you crying?

999
01:31:40,750 --> 01:31:41,917
Miss Alcázar,

1000
01:31:43,292 --> 01:31:46,292
can you tell us
what happened that night?

1001
01:31:50,042 --> 01:31:51,958
Miss Alcázar, did you hear me?

1002
01:31:52,958 --> 01:31:56,208
Can you tell us
what happened that night?

1003
01:32:12,167 --> 01:32:13,625
Babi! Wait!

1004
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,583
Why are you humiliating our family?

1005
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:26,125
What will they think of us?
We promised we'd help them!

1006
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:28,375
No, you promised, I didn't.

1007
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:32,250
Stop being ashamed for me,
stop deciding for me.

1008
01:32:32,875 --> 01:32:36,375
I refuse to grow old
and realize I've become like you.

1009
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:40,208
I won't live your lousy life.

1010
01:32:41,542 --> 01:32:44,667
H is my boyfriend
and I want to be with him.

1011
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:11,500
I won't lie for you again.

1012
01:33:11,875 --> 01:33:13,042
You hear?

1013
01:33:15,083 --> 01:33:17,833
If you keep doing as you please,
we're through, I swear.

1014
01:33:19,875 --> 01:33:21,250
Very well.

1015
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:23,208
I'll change.

1016
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:41,583
They've passed!

1017
01:33:42,042 --> 01:33:43,375
I passed!

1018
01:33:43,583 --> 01:33:46,125
Be quick,
we've got something to do.

1019
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:49,375
I got the best grade!

1020
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:54,292
Forga gave me an 8.
I thought she'd fail me.

1021
01:33:54,833 --> 01:33:56,000
I'm proud of you.

1022
01:33:58,208 --> 01:33:59,500
We have to go.

1023
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:01,250
- Where?
- Pollo!

1024
01:34:07,333 --> 01:34:09,875
- Come on, Pollo!
- Behave yourself, Pepito.

1025
01:34:10,333 --> 01:34:13,292
Don't gulp your food.
You know it makes you sick.

1026
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:17,833
He doesn't want
to go back to the witch.

1027
01:34:18,042 --> 01:34:19,042
Who is it?

1028
01:34:19,292 --> 01:34:20,750
Pepito Delivery Service.

1029
01:34:21,542 --> 01:34:24,500
And don't dare treat him
like you treat your pupils.

1030
01:34:24,708 --> 01:34:25,500
You hear?

1031
01:34:25,708 --> 01:34:27,250
Move, Al Capone!

1032
01:34:31,292 --> 01:34:32,375
So long, buddy.

1033
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,667
There'll be more than 100 of us.

1034
01:34:36,292 --> 01:34:39,292
No, not a private room,
the whole restaurant.

1035
01:34:40,167 --> 01:34:42,542
Yes, a very special occasion.

1036
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:45,000
Not just her good grades.

1037
01:34:45,208 --> 01:34:47,750
A daughter doesn't
turn 18 every day.

1038
01:34:47,958 --> 01:34:50,917
I'll send the guest list
this afternoon.

1039
01:34:51,417 --> 01:34:53,125
- Mom....
- Yes?

1040
01:34:53,542 --> 01:34:55,125
In case you'd forgotten,

1041
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:57,333
Hugo Olivera, my boyfriend.

1042
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:10,042
- Hi, Laura! Did you pass?
- Yes.

1043
01:35:15,917 --> 01:35:16,958
Come in.

1044
01:35:18,333 --> 01:35:20,042
Good morning.

1045
01:35:21,500 --> 01:35:22,667
I wanted to thank you....

1046
01:35:26,417 --> 01:35:27,458
Pepito?

1047
01:35:48,125 --> 01:35:49,375
I want to marry her.

1048
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:51,833
First you need a job.

1049
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:56,708
Or will she go on paying
for everything, like she does now.

1050
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:58,792
Tomorrow, I'm going to win.

1051
01:35:59,667 --> 01:36:01,000
So she can see me do it.

1052
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:05,542
Our girls are incredible.

1053
01:36:07,083 --> 01:36:08,333
We have to live up to them.

1054
01:36:10,042 --> 01:36:11,250
She'll love it.

1055
01:36:15,667 --> 01:36:17,667
- I'll get it.
- H...

1056
01:36:19,792 --> 01:36:21,458
Promise you'll be there.

1057
01:36:22,125 --> 01:36:23,208
What do you think?

1058
01:36:39,375 --> 01:36:40,500
Pollo...

1059
01:36:49,458 --> 01:36:51,458
It's Babi!
Here, take this.

1060
01:36:52,958 --> 01:36:53,875
Hello.

1061
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:55,667
Can we talk?

1062
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,417
Sure.

1063
01:36:58,625 --> 01:37:00,250
You threatened my teacher!

1064
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:03,125
Are you stupid?

1065
01:37:04,958 --> 01:37:06,333
You screwed me, H.

1066
01:37:08,208 --> 01:37:10,958
- I thought that if...
- Stop thinking for me!

1067
01:37:12,125 --> 01:37:14,167
Don't treat me like a moron.

1068
01:37:18,292 --> 01:37:20,250
Let's leave it for a while.

1069
01:37:41,625 --> 01:37:44,042
- Shall I say anything to him?
- No.

1070
01:37:49,542 --> 01:37:51,750
I'll be along after the race, OK?

1071
01:38:05,667 --> 01:38:08,000
The dopey upstairs neighbor,

1072
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:09,792
he'll take us to the party.

1073
01:38:18,375 --> 01:38:20,042
You're a fucking genius.

1074
01:38:22,417 --> 01:38:23,375
Come on.

1075
01:39:08,917 --> 01:39:11,125
- Have you seen H?
- No, I haven't.

1076
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:39,333
Babi,

1077
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:41,042
come here a moment.

1078
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:45,625
Carlos,

1079
01:39:45,875 --> 01:39:46,833
this is Babi.

1080
01:39:47,042 --> 01:39:48,542
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1081
01:39:52,625 --> 01:39:53,917
My love.

1082
01:39:54,208 --> 01:39:55,417
A photo.

1083
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:03,375
What would happen
if I asked your sister out?

1084
01:40:03,792 --> 01:40:07,583
Her boyfriend would break
every bone in your body.

1085
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:09,083
That's all.

1086
01:40:09,583 --> 01:40:10,708
Hi, dad!

1087
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:12,625
Hello.

1088
01:40:26,292 --> 01:40:27,583
Hey, where's your buddy?

1089
01:40:27,792 --> 01:40:29,708
I want some fucking revenge.

1090
01:40:30,792 --> 01:40:32,042
I'm racing for him today.

1091
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:49,417
I love you.

1092
01:43:09,750 --> 01:43:11,792
Who is our daughter dancing with?

1093
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:15,125
With a good boy, Rafaela.

1094
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:28,417
Be careful!
Stop, stop!

1095
01:44:35,292 --> 01:44:37,583
Forgive me, I'm sorry, Babi.

1096
01:44:37,792 --> 01:44:40,042
It's all right, Gustavo.

1097
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,625
I said it's all right.
Leave me alone!

1098
01:44:49,833 --> 01:44:52,250
She told you twice
to leave her alone! Get out!

1099
01:44:52,542 --> 01:44:54,708
I'm just trying to help her.

1100
01:44:59,417 --> 01:45:00,833
What are you doing, H?

1101
01:45:01,917 --> 01:45:03,292
He didn't do it on purpose!

1102
01:45:06,208 --> 01:45:07,500
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

1103
01:45:08,458 --> 01:45:09,917
You think he meant to do it?

1104
01:45:20,083 --> 01:45:21,250
Yes?

1105
01:45:27,208 --> 01:45:29,167
Come on.

1106
01:45:30,042 --> 01:45:31,417
I'm sorry, Claudio.

1107
01:45:59,667 --> 01:46:01,458
- Katina! What is it?
- Pollo.

1108
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,667
Where is he?
They won't tell me.

1109
01:46:04,417 --> 01:46:05,708
Look for him, H.

1110
01:46:05,958 --> 01:46:07,333
Please, I'm begging you.

1111
01:46:15,583 --> 01:46:16,833
Where is he?

1112
01:46:17,958 --> 01:46:19,000
Over there.

1113
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:27,958
You can't get through.

1114
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:35,000
Calm down.

1115
01:46:35,208 --> 01:46:38,042
Let go of me! Let go of me!
Pollo!

1116
01:46:38,708 --> 01:46:41,875
Let go of me!
He's my friend!

1117
01:47:13,958 --> 01:47:16,000
H!
H, stop, please!

1118
01:47:16,292 --> 01:47:18,333
Please! H!

1119
01:47:42,667 --> 01:47:43,750
- Don't touch me!
- Listen.

1120
01:47:43,958 --> 01:47:45,000
- Don't touch me!
- Listen.

1121
01:47:45,208 --> 01:47:46,125
I can't take any more.

1122
01:47:46,333 --> 01:47:49,042
Your life is full of shit
and death and blood,

1123
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:50,708
you don't care about me.

1124
01:47:50,917 --> 01:47:53,292
I do care,
and Babi, I swear that...

1125
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:56,500
Don't swear anything.
You don't care about anyone.

1126
01:47:56,708 --> 01:47:58,125
Not me or your family
or your best friend.

1127
01:47:58,333 --> 01:47:59,208
It's not my fault!

1128
01:47:59,417 --> 01:48:00,667
- Yes, it is!
- It's not!

1129
01:48:00,875 --> 01:48:02,292
Of course it is!

1130
01:48:03,417 --> 01:48:06,708
You killed Pollo!
You killed him!

1131
01:49:32,917 --> 01:49:35,208
There's always a moment
when the road forks.

1132
01:49:41,083 --> 01:49:45,125
Each one goes off, thinking
the roads will come together again.

1133
01:49:53,708 --> 01:49:54,750
Come in.

1134
01:49:57,417 --> 01:50:00,125
You see the other person
getting smaller and smaller.

1135
01:50:03,708 --> 01:50:05,083
That's all right.

1136
01:50:05,750 --> 01:50:07,333
We're made for each other.

1137
01:50:13,417 --> 01:50:15,000
She'll be there at the end.

1138
01:50:17,917 --> 01:50:19,500
But at the end
only one thing happens.

1139
01:50:28,208 --> 01:50:29,750
The fucking winter comes.

1140
01:51:00,750 --> 01:51:03,625
Yes, yes. Don't keep on.
I'm eating well, Alex.

1141
01:51:05,417 --> 01:51:07,375
There's someone at the door.
I'll call you later.

1142
01:51:18,917 --> 01:51:20,292
Merry Christmas!

1143
01:51:25,917 --> 01:51:27,708
Come in, please.

1144
01:51:34,375 --> 01:51:37,333
I haven't been around much
these last months.

1145
01:51:39,333 --> 01:51:40,875
I couldn't, I'm sorry.

1146
01:51:42,583 --> 01:51:44,000
Don't worry.

1147
01:51:48,875 --> 01:51:50,667
Santa left this for you.

1148
01:52:12,167 --> 01:52:14,250
I miss him so much, H.

1149
01:52:15,583 --> 01:52:16,792
I can't...

1150
01:52:17,208 --> 01:52:19,958
Sometimes I think
I'll never find anyone like him.

1151
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:22,542
No, no one like him.

1152
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:26,917
But you'll find someone
who'll make you happy.

1153
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,792
Have you spoken to Babi?

1154
01:52:36,333 --> 01:52:37,417
Have you?

1155
01:52:39,625 --> 01:52:42,208
We lost touch after the accident.

1156
01:52:43,375 --> 01:52:45,167
I think she's with another crowd.

1157
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,500
And she's going out
with some guy.

1158
01:52:53,042 --> 01:52:55,292
Maybe you should forget her.

1159
01:53:00,458 --> 01:53:01,958
Want to stay for supper?

1160
01:53:04,208 --> 01:53:05,208
I can't tonight.

1161
01:53:05,875 --> 01:53:07,542
Some other day.

1162
01:53:22,208 --> 01:53:23,375
Thank you.

1163
01:53:28,375 --> 01:53:29,500
That's OK.

1164
01:54:10,333 --> 01:54:11,292
Yes?

1165
01:54:11,500 --> 01:54:12,500
Hello.

1166
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:15,500
Is Babi there?

1167
01:54:16,708 --> 01:54:17,833
Just a minute.

1168
01:54:19,083 --> 01:54:20,083
Bye, mom.

1169
01:54:20,292 --> 01:54:21,458
Call me tomorrow.

1170
01:54:22,500 --> 01:54:23,542
Take care of her.

1171
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:25,042
I will, Rafaela.

1172
01:54:39,458 --> 01:54:40,625
Are you ready?

1173
01:54:42,625 --> 01:54:44,250
We're leaving in five minutes.

1174
01:55:28,375 --> 01:55:29,625
What are you doing here?

1175
01:55:30,667 --> 01:55:32,833
- I locked myself out.
- OK, come on.

1176
01:55:36,375 --> 01:55:37,583
What's wrong?

1177
01:55:39,042 --> 01:55:40,167
Hugo, what's wrong?

1178
01:55:42,375 --> 01:55:43,750
What's happened?

1179
01:56:16,708 --> 01:56:19,667
Suddenly you realize
that everything is over.

1180
01:56:22,167 --> 01:56:23,417
Really.

1181
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:33,375
I'm going away for a while.

1182
01:56:35,958 --> 01:56:37,333
To London.

1183
01:56:37,667 --> 01:56:39,000
To work.

1184
01:56:44,458 --> 01:56:46,000
That's a good idea.

1185
01:56:56,875 --> 01:56:58,542
I can't stay here.

1186
01:56:59,167 --> 01:57:00,542
There's no going back.

1187
01:57:01,708 --> 01:57:03,083
You feel it.

1188
01:57:27,417 --> 01:57:30,917
And then you try to remember
at what point it all began.

1189
01:57:32,375 --> 01:57:35,125
And you discover it started
before you thought.

1190
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:36,833
Hello.

1191
01:57:41,083 --> 01:57:42,208
Hello.

1192
01:57:42,833 --> 01:57:44,000
Long before.

1193
01:57:47,208 --> 01:57:50,042
And it's at that moment

1194
01:57:50,375 --> 01:57:53,250
you realize
things only happen once.

1195
01:58:13,125 --> 01:58:17,083
And no matter how hard you try
you'll never feel the same again.

1196
01:58:17,958 --> 01:58:21,792
You'll never again feel
you're three meters above the sky.

1197
01:58:26,458 --> 01:58:30,167
THREE METERS ABOVE THE SKY
